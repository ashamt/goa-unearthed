            Residential architecture still bears the mark of the Portuguese, over 60 years of liberation. A vast, central courtyard framed by a slanted roof, tiled a rich red, mark the blend of Portuguese practices and the local resources and conventions. Red laterite stone forms the foundation of these homes, as the porous red bricks are available in plenty throughout Goa. High ceilings and arched windows accommodate for the humid climate and long summers that Goan residents have become familiar with.     
            During the afternoon ‘siesta,’ when shops close as people seek shade from an unrelenting sun, the clay balcaos perched on the edge of nearly every verandah come into use, providing a lounging spot with a full garden view.

            Velha Goa, also called Old Goa, is the former Portuguese capital, considered a World Heritage Site and famed for the Baroque style churches and heritage mansions that line its streets. While many traditional Portuguese Goan houses are revered for the enduring beauty and chronicles of the past that they carry, the distinctive architectural touch of Goa truly shines upon walking through a humble coastal village such as Morjim. Here, houses explode in an array of bright pink, blue, green and yellow. Each home has history infused into every laterite brick. Often, one generation will build the first layer of a house, leaving a flat roof and a set of stairs outside so that their descendants can carry on with construction.

    The art of Goan architecture lies in the handcrafted, in the uneven mother-of-pearl shells used in windows and the irregular laterite bricks. Built upon layers of influences from long before the Portuguese, from the Kadambas to the Muslims of the Deccan, the design of the Goan home is a colourful amalgamation of vastly different cultures fusing together over centuries.
