          Goaâ€™s religious and cultural history is shrouded in mythology and legend, beginning with the Saraswat Brahmins, who originated on the bank of the Saraswat river and settled in Goa sometime around 1000 BCE. 96 Gaud Saraswat families came to Goa by sea and found homes along the Konkan coast. Until 1350 CE, Goa was mostly under the rule of Hindu dynasties. Of this era, the Shree Mahadev temple of Tamdesurla is the only temple to remain standing.
          
          After Muslim rule that lasted almost 200 years, the Portuguese seized control of Goa, bringing with them Catholicism and conversion. In the centuries that followed, Hinduism has remained, though left with the indelible mark of the Portuguese that has yet to fade.

          While Catholicism is often broadcasted as the principle faith of Goa, multiple supposedly distinct religions are inextricably interwoven in a show of the tolerance that defines the state. In many cases, the values of Catholics coincide with rather than contradict those of Hindus, the most populous group in Goa. Despite differences born from a wrought history, Hindus, Catholics, and other religious groups are united in blood and in identity as Goans.
          Liberation in 1961 has certainly redefined the religious structure of Goa, with a rising Hindu population and the amalgamation of various religious customs can finally be expressed. The faiths of Goa now exist in a pluralistic harmony. It is not uncommon to find a cross draped in a mala of marigolds, a physical symbol of how Christianity has blended with the indigenous traditions of Goa.
