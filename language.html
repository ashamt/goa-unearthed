              Goa has gone by many names, such as Gomanchala, Gopakapattana, Govapuri, Govem, Sindapur, Sandabur, and Mahassapatam, and its people have spoken many tongues. The mother tongue rarely spoken beyond state borders, is Konkani, a language that draws influences from Sanskrit, Marathi, Arabic, Kannada, and, in the past century, Portuguese. The Konkani of modern-day has branched into many dialects that differ based on one’s regional and cultural background. And yet, despite this unique adaptability, Konkani is in rapid decline, as with globalization comes a desire for linguistic assimilation. For many Goans, education in Konkani is not accessible or even useful, as Goan independence has led to the inpouring of English, Hindi and Marathi into the state.

<p>
  With no official script, Konkani can be written in the Devanagri, Kannada, Malayalam, Arabic, and Latin alphabets. For the Goan Christian, Roman script is usually favoured, while the Goan Hindu will often write Konkani in Devanagari. In the few other areas where Konkani is used, such as parts of Karnataka and Kerala, Konkani moulds itself to be written in the speech of more prevalent local languages. Under Portuguese rule, Konkani that was previously written in existing Indian scripts became scattered with Portuguese words and written in Roman, spoken alongside a dominating Portuguese. Since those times, the language has fractured into different dialects, tilting towards Marathi, Kannada, or Portuguese based on the location, caste, and religion of the speaker. This means that a Goan Catholic from South Goa might be speaking a Konkani that is almost incomprehensible to the Hindu from Mapusa.

    In today’s Goa, one comprised of nomads and travellers coming from different continents or just across the state border, it is more common to hear a blend of tongues spoken, beyond just Konkani. The lingering impact of the British on India and a rise in tourism since liberation means that English is commonly spoken throughout the state. Similarly, Hindi is becoming increasingly more popular as a link language between Goa and other parts of India.
