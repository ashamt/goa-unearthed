      Goa’s land is rich with biodiversity and beauty, with landscapes ranging from paddy fields in vivid shades of monsoon green to the roaring rush of clear blue water at Dudhsagar waterfall to the endlessly familiar ocean scenery that brushes against the soft golden sand. History has dictated that, until liberation, the environment in Goa has remained relatively untouched, as locals have learned to live in harmony with nature. Many villagers continue to rely on fishing in the Arabian Sea or harvesting rice in paddy fields as a source of income. Goan dishes are fundamentally based on ingredients that are both native to Goa and have learned to call it home, such as coconut, kokum, and mango. The mango alone lends its name to fifteen villages across Goa, and the names of dozens of other villages are similarly derived from the kokum, banyan, tamarind, and tulsi. The backbone of Goan life is its land.

        As people who hold Goa dear to our hearts, we must understand the value of conservation in the preservation of the ecosystems that allow us to thrive. Mining activity has led to deforestation, water pollution, and land degradation, especially in recent decades. The increasingly omnipresent tourist industry is often unaware of the environmental effects of commercialisation. Goa’s complex ecosystems and astonishing natural sights are undoubtedly worthy of protection and conservation; as individuals and communities, our contributions to this area of concern are valuable and necessary.

        Beyond the reach of humanity, the natural world of Goa exists in an eclectic blend of species, from the Olive Ridley turtle which habitually returns to nesting sites along the Konkan coast to the macaque monkeys who swing effortlessly from branches. Accompanying the effervescent spirit of these wild animals is an abundance of stray cows, water buffalos, dogs, and cats, to whom Goans often demonstrate a remarkable affection.

      Goa is the home of the swaying coconut tree, gentle in the breeze as it carries the song of the village in its leaves. It is the home of the wandering stray, cautious yet eager in its search for permanence. It is the home of rustling forests, lush with dark green foliage and alight with unparalleled biodiversity. It is a land of layers, with an ancient reality that appears forever elusive, its reality only visible once unearthed.
