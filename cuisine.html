        In Goa, the lines between people of different religions and backgrounds are often drawn thinly, marked by seemingly minor facets of life, often involving cuisine. Hindu or Catholic, the staple meal for many Goans is one of fish curry, rice, and vegetables. The main distinction between the two is that the Catholic diet tends to include a variety of different kinds of meat, as introduced by the Portuguese.
        Given the rich natural resources of the state and the history of its people’s close ties to the land, it is no surprise that its cuisine relies heavily on locally grown vegetables. The Konkan Khatkhate curry is one such example, prepared with up to twenty seasonal vegetables and a fiery blend of spices that all but define Goan cuisine.

      At the height of Portuguese rule in the 16th century, Goa was a major commercial port, the recipient of goods from Portuguese colonies globally. Through this process, ingredients now seen as essential to Goan and Indian cuisine were introduced and began to become integrated with existing methods of preparing food. Bread, chilis, pineapple, potatoes, tomatoes, and vinegar all entered Goa through the Portuguese. Now, after these influences have had centuries to brew, it’s impossible to discuss Goan cuisine without mention of the distinctive pao bread or the heat added from chilis, both introduced by the Portuguese.

Pre-European culinary practices and indigenous ingredients are still pervasive in Goan cooking, as it is near impossible to cook Goan food without coconut and kokum, a sour dark red fruit dried and used liberally. Clay pots, in which food was traditionally cooked over wood fires, can still be found lurking in the corners of Mapusa Market, waiting to enrich the flavour of dishes that mix ancient and new.
